1_data_preparation.ipynb: Notebook to load the netCDF4  files of the dataset, convert to consumable format for the project and 
                          save the training and testing dataset in csv format

2_data_analysis.ipynb: Notebook that loads the training dataset and performs multicollinearity and correlation analysis on the 
                       parameters

3_modelling_lstm.ipynb: Notebook that contains the LSTM model construction and training code and explainability using SHAP. 
                        This also include testing and performance evaluation code.

4_modelling_stgcn.ipynb: Notebook that contains the STGCN model construction and training code and explainability using 
                         PGExplainer from torch.geometric. This also include testing and performance evaluation code.

5_compression.ipynb: Notebook for compressing the LSTM and STGCN models using two algorithms: dynamic quantisation and distillation.
